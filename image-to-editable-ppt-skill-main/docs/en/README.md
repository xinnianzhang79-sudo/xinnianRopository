Image to Editable PPT is a skill that converts images, PDFs, and image-based PowerPoint files into **object-level editable PowerPoint presentations** (`.pptx`). It first normalizes the input into page-level tasks, then rebuilds each page as a `.pptx`: readable text is restored as native text boxes whenever possible, simple geometry is recreated as PowerPoint shapes, and complex visual elements are preserved as separate image assets with source records.

## Key Features

- Multiple input formats: convert a single image, multiple images, a multi-page PDF, or an image-based PowerPoint file into an editable `.pptx`.
- Object-level reconstruction: text becomes native text boxes, simple geometry becomes PowerPoint shapes, and complex visual elements remain separate image assets, so all three object types can be adjusted independently.
- Supports complete native curve paths, dash styles, and endpoint arrows for editing a whole line’s shape and style; curve paths are not data-linked charts. In PowerPoint, right-click a curve, choose **Edit Points**, select an endpoint or vertex, and drag its white control handle to adjust curvature.
- Measurement-driven text restoration: OCR generates text annotations for every page, including bounding boxes, font sizes, font-size groups, and recognized text. The model reconstructs text from these measurements and automatically keeps same-level text at consistent sizes. See the OCR Token section in [Installation and Configuration](/en/installation.md).
- Parallel multi-page reconstruction: the main agent dispatches multi-page inputs to page workers/subagents in parallel; single-page inputs use the same reconstruction flow locally in the main agent.
- Image generation and editing prefer the current agent's built-in `image_gen.imagegen` tool. Only defined fallback conditions invoke `editppt image`, whose CLI selects between Codex OAuth and an OpenAI-compatible API.
- Speaker notes from `.pptx` inputs are copied unchanged to the matching output pages without translation, summarization, or rewriting.
- Stable page order: multiple images follow the order provided, while PDFs and `.pptx` files preserve their original page order.

## Important Notes

**This is not a lightweight converter.** The skill uses a multi-agent reconstruction workflow in which AI performs a rebuild → self-check → page-level revision loop, potentially over multiple iterations. It can consume substantial tokens: reconstructing a 10-slide deck may use an entire five-hour ChatGPT allowance, and a single slide may take more than 10 minutes. **ChatGPT Pro is recommended; Plus users should proceed with caution.**

**Do not use this skill unless you have a strong need for editability.** A lighter alternative is to use `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst` directly: send it the slide image you want to change and ask it to make the targeted edits.

**We recommend running this skill in Codex with Full Access enabled.** Otherwise, approval prompts may repeatedly interrupt OCR, image generation, and subagent dispatch. See [Installation and Configuration](/en/installation.md).

This skill does not create a new presentation from an article, report, outline, or idea. If your goal is to generate a presentation, use [codex-ppt-skill](https://github.com/ningzimu/codex-ppt-skill).
