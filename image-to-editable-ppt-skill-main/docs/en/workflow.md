# Standard Workflow

This page describes the complete conversion process from input to final `.pptx`, so you can understand what the AI is doing and what each stage produces.

> Failed page validation leads to local repairs that reuse verified assets. Work stops when the current outputs pass checks; acceptable minor fringes do not trigger regeneration. Routine steps run autonomously; missing OCR tokens or blocked OCR still require user input. Complex pages can still consume substantial tokens.

## End-to-End Process

1. **Create a task directory and normalize the input**: create an isolated task directory, normalize the input (images, PDF, or image-based PowerPoint) into `pages/page_NNN/source.png`, detect whether built-in `image_gen.imagegen` is available, and record the image backend selected for the run.
2. **Create OCR text annotations (when a Token is configured)**: submit the entire input to OCR as a batch task. OCR produces page-level text annotations—bounding boxes, measured font sizes, font-size groups, and recognized text—which guide measurement-based text reconstruction.
3. **Dispatch pages**: for a one-page input, the main agent claims the page with `editppt run dispatch --local` and reconstructs it locally. For multi-page input, pages are dispatched in batches of up to `max_concurrent_pages` to page workers for parallel reconstruction.
4. **Reconstruct and self-check each page**: each reconstructor owns its page directory and performs reconstruction, source comparison, and page-local corrections, rechecking only affected objects and layout after changes and stopping once checks pass. It creates a manifest and rebuilds editable text, simple shapes, and image assets. When needed, it uses the image backend to separate foreground and background elements or extract assets.
5. **Record state**: `editppt` commands record dispatch state, page results, and acceptance state, so progress can be inspected at any time.
6. **Assemble and validate the final deck**: the main agent runs `editppt run finalize`, reads each accepted `manifest.json` in page order, rebuilds the final `.pptx`, copies speaker notes from `.pptx` inputs, and runs deck validation.

Asset sheets use a flat background color distinct from the subjects by default. After background removal, whole-object regions preserve disconnected details during cropping. Successful splitting still requires checking each asset against the source.

Rebuilds regular row-and-column tables as native PowerPoint tables with editable cells, row/column dimensions, rectangular merges, and basic styling.

## Input-to-Output Mapping

The output is always a PowerPoint `.pptx`:

| Input | Output |
| --- | --- |
| One image | One-slide `.pptx` |
| Multiple images | Multi-slide `.pptx`, one slide per image in the order provided |
| Multi-page PDF | Multi-slide `.pptx`, with PDF page N mapped to output slide N |
| Image-based PowerPoint | A `.pptx` with the same slide count, with source slide N mapped to output slide N |

Only `.pptx` inputs include speaker-note handling. The main agent copies notes unchanged to the corresponding output slides without translation, summarization, rewriting, or page-worker processing.

## Output Directory Structure

Each conversion uses an isolated output directory that contains all intermediate files and final results:

```text
output/image-to-editable-ppt/{job-id}/        # Conversion task directory
├── input/                                    # Copy of the original input

## Limitations

- This skill reconstructs an input page as editable objects; it does not generate a new presentation from scratch. That is the responsibility of [codex-ppt-skill](https://github.com/ningzimu/codex-ppt-skill).
- Complex visual elements such as photos, illustrations, textures, and hand-drawn decoration can usually be moved only as separate image assets; their internal objects are not guaranteed to be editable.
- Native tables do not yet support diagonal headers or images embedded in cells. Unclear text, rows, columns, or merges are checked against the source and OCR first; unresolved details are reported without guessing content or structure. Charts and flowcharts continue to use editable structural objects.
- Some image elements and text positions may be slightly offset. A 100% match to the source page is not guaranteed.
- If the defined image generation or editing path cannot produce a compliant asset, the page fails or remains blocked. The skill does not downgrade the missing asset to a warning, nor does it record, finalize, or deliver an incomplete substitute.
- Visual similarity does not guarantee editability. Final evaluation should consider the PPTX structure, text coverage, asset provenance, and preview/diff together.
